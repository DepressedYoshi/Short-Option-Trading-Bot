# Short-Option-Trading-Bot

## Intro
This is a algorism trading project that uses [quantconnect's](https://github.com/QuantConnect) framework and back testing data. The primary strategy is to short any abnormal rise in the market using options. This strategy is inspired by a period of personal experimentation during covid and the rise of meme stock like GameStop. Make no mistake, my intension was to profit off of the eventual failure of wall street bet and not support them. 
I notice that sudden spike in prices that exceeds 20% are quite common and, logically, all of them should be shorted. For a short while I check the market weekly to select 1-4 "abnormal" stocks to short with option (not all of them can be traded with option) and it was medium successful. By that, I means 80% of the time my prediction would be correct however I make mistakes due to the emotional impact of the volatile movements, which led to me turn to algorism based trading, to both better filter, evaluate, and execute a trade. It all seems intuitive, it is a highly structured and calculated strategy with high ROT but also high risk. It deals with stocks that has significantly increase or decreased in a short timeframe, highly volatile movement means this is def not "investment" and more "trading. Hence, it is handled by a algorism and not human. 
Option are chosen for the sake of leverage and profit. This is purely an experimental component to see if algorism can limit the risk of option trading to justify it. Moreover, I am lazy and I have other things to do in life. This trading strategy require constant monitoring but not high frequency trading which seems perfect to be managed by a bot that can be deployed by average joe like myself.
